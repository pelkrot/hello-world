# hello-world
Exactly what it says.

Beyond the rim of the starlight
my love is wand'ring in star flight.
I knew he'll find in star-clustered reaches
love, strange love a star woman teaches.
I know his journey end never
his star trek will go on forever
but tell him as he wanders his starry sea
Remember. Remember me.
